# Overview

`equation_scraper` is a Python package that scrapes Wikipedia pages for mathematical equations and then parses the equations into its components to build prior distributions. Specifically, these priors include information such as the number of times an operator or function appears across all equations scraped. For example, the expression `m*x+b*sin(y)` would be parsed into the simple prior: `{*: 2, +: 1, sin: 1}`. The package includes much more information than this simple prior, for example conditional priors---a full breakdown of the included metrics is detailed on the `Priors` section of our documentation. The package was designed to provide equation discovery modelling techniques, such as Symbolic Regression and the Bayesian Machine Scientist, with informed priors; however, the application of this package can extend far beyond this.
